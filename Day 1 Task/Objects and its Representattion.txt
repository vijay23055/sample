Objects and its internal representation:
          objects are important data types in javascript.objects are different than primitive datatypes numbers, string, bool, null etc., here primitive contain one value at a time but objects hold many values in form of key pair.

           These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively in the context of an object

Example:
    
var mybike = new object();  here we are creating object the object name is mybike

mybike.company = "BMW";
mybike.model = " G 310GS"
mybike.year = 2024
  
here mybike is object it's hold many values in form of key pair.


Object Methods:
           Object method is an object property containing a function definition.

Creating Objects in JS:

        Object with ObjectLiteral:
                       let bike  = {name: "ADV", maker:"BMW", engine:" G 310 GS"}
 
        Object with constructor:
                       we can create an  object using constructor 
                       function Vehicle(name, maker) {
                                    this.name = name;
                                    this.maker = maker;
                                                    }
                                       let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
                                       let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
