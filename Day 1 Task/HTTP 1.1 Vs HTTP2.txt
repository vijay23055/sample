HTTP - Hypertext Transfer protocol, so its used in client server communication.Using HTTP user can send the request to the server and the server sends the response to the user.

HTTP 1.1:
      when we make a request to the server for some exmaple website(www.example.com) page and server responds to source page before sending the request and there is a TCP response connection will establish will happen between client & server, again we need to make a request for image and serrrver will give response for image which means we need to give several requests &  responses are merged in a single connection. In HTTP 1.1 we have some drawbacks that lead to HTTP 2
          
      DrawBacks:
           1.Transfer all the requests and responses in the plain text message.
           2.Head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other request until response does not receive.
           3.All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request



HTTP 2:
      It was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP 2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual converts all the messages into binary format.This layer encapsulates messages- converted to its binary equivalent.HTTP 2developers introduced a binary frame layer this layer partitions requests and responses in tiny data packets and encodes them. Because of this multiple requests and responses able to run parallelly with HTTP 2 and chances of HOL blocking are bleak.


HTTP 1.1 - It uses requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.It compress data by itself.

HTTP 2 - It uses PUsh frame by server that collects all multiples pages. It uses HPACKk compression.
